# Session Handoff Log

Purpose: end each session with a tiny handoff that reflects the **current rescue rebuild reality**, not the old system.

Rule:
If a capability existed only in the old repo/docs but is not rebuilt in the current repo, do not describe it as active.

## Latest Handoff
Date: 2026-03-26
Checkpoint: CHK-R36 + CHK-R36b
Git commits: `4e38506`, `2d14b0b` on branch `rescue-minimum`
Goal of session: Redesign the Price Config tab in `public/tour-config.html` to show a customer-facing Booking View (segment tiers, per-pax-type qty controls, live price calculator) instead of the flat admin grid; then add full CRUD for seasons and segments.

### What was completed this session

**CHK-R36 — Price Config tab: Customer Booking View**
- `public/tour-config.html` — replaced 3-column admin grid with:
  - **Booking View card** (top): segment tier buttons (auto-select first on load), 4-row pax table (Adult Shared Room, Adult Private Room, Child with parents, Infant) with ±qty steppers and unit price / subtotal columns, travel date input (triggers `POST /api/pricing/calculate` for season-aware total + footnote showing applied season + pax band)
  - **Collapsible admin `<details>`** (bottom): 2-col grid Seasons + Pax Bands; Segments; Tour Prices table. All existing IDs preserved.
  - New CSS: `.seg-tab`, `.seg-tab.active`, `.qty-wrap`, `.qty-btn`, `.qty-val`

**CHK-R36b — Season/Segment full CRUD + editable dates**
- Season dates (start/end month+day) now render as 4 editable `<input type="number">` fields — each fires `PATCH /api/pricing/tenant-seasons/:id` on blur
- **Add Season form**: Name + from month/from day/to month/to day → `POST /api/pricing/tenant-seasons`
- **Add Segment form**: Label + Code (auto-uppercased) → `POST /api/pricing/pricing-segments`
- Both season and segment rows already had delete (`×`) buttons from previous session
- Fixed `updatePricingItem` to correctly handle numeric field values

### Files changed

docs/ai/01_CURRENT_STATE.md
docs/ai/04_SESSION_HANDOFF.md
```

### What is still not done / testing in progress
- Agent has not finished testing the Price Config tab in the running dev server — visual verification partially done, full CRUD flow (add season, add pax band, add segment, add tour price, run calculate) still pending
- `wrangler dev` runs on port 8787; ensure it is running before testing: `npx wrangler dev`
- Apply local migrations if needed: `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply travel_agent_db --local`

### Known risks
- Season date PATCH sends values as strings from `<input type="number">`; backend `coerceNumeric()` handles the int conversion — verify on first edit
- `POST /api/pricing/calculate` requires an existing tour price row matching the selected segment + date's season + pax count band; if no matching row, fallback total is shown (raw sum from base price row)
- Segment tabs auto-select the first segment on `loadPricing()` — if the tenant has no segments yet, the tab area shows a help message pointing to the Manage section

### Suggested next prompt
```
Read:
1. docs/ai/01_CURRENT_STATE.md
2. docs/ai/03_PROGRESS_LEDGER.md

Open http://localhost:8787/tour-config.html
Connect with tenant ten-demo-001, select a tour.
Go to Price Config tab and test:
1. Add a season (name, dates)
2. Add a segment (label, code)
3. Add a pax band
4. Add a tour price row linking them
5. In Booking View, select the new segment, set qty, pick a travel date → verify grand total appears
6. Delete a season and a segment — confirm loadPricing() refreshes cleanly

If all pass, CHK-R36 is DONE. Proceed to the next planned feature.
```
